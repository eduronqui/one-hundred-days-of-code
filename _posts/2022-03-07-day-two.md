## #100DaysOfCode

Today I've been exploring the idea of [nominal typing](https://michalzalecki.com/nominal-typing-in-typescript/) in TypesScript.
Taking advantage of it's powerful and flexible typing system, TS allows to easily create very unique and tailored types such as:

```typescript
type Brand<K, T> = K & { __brand: T }

type USD = Brand<number, "USD">
type EUR = Brand<number, "EUR">

const dollars = 500 as USD // ok
const euros: EUR = dollars // Error: Type '"USD"' is not assignable to type '"EUR"'
```

This kind of types allows for expressing types in more meaningful ways and helps preventing silly mistakes like mixing IDs because they are all just numbers.

Today I also went a bit back and forth with how the monorepo should be structured and testing how things work when combining Lerna and NPM Workspaces. So far it seems to be a good pair.

### Progress

My progress today was trying out and getting familiar with the monorepo and this new idea of nominal types.
