## #100DaysOfCode

It's been a bit challenging to coordinate doing this along with my personal life.
I'll have to shuffle my schedule a bit but I don't want to lose this, not now that I am getting some momentum.

### Progress

Today I was figuring out how GitHub Actions work and it's kinda powerful!
I also started writing down my thoughts and ideas as issues.
I'm trying to get organized here!
