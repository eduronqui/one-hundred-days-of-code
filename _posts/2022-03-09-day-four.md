## #100DaysOfCode

Today I spent quite some time fighting typescript, the monorepo and fastify.
All the odds were against me, it seems.

It all started because I wanted to have a custom property on a lerna context which led me to augmenting that type [^1] which, in turn, made ts-node a bit unhappy since it doesn't read the `typings` folder by default [^2].

On the quest to fix my ts-node issue I had to change a bit my ts-config which messed up with VS Code when I have the whole monorepo opened.
Meaning, if I don't want to write tests with broken autocompletion and type suggestion I have to load that project (content-emitter) in a separate window so the service root is the VS Code root.

Yeah... this was a bit hectic. I was actually planning to _quickly_ get the config thingy solved and spend some time working on a kafka event producer but today the world said "nah!".

### Progress

On the bright side, now I have config files, more stable typings and a fancier pre-commit hook that will build and test my changes.
