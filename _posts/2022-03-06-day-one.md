## #100DaysOfCode

Today I am starting my #100DaysOfCodeChallenge and with that I am aiming at learn a bunch of things that might be interesting in the long run, among others:

* [Lerna monorepo](https://lerna.js.org/)
* [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
* [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)
* Some front end skills (mostly [react](https://reactjs.org/))

### Bird's eye view

I'll be building a bunch of services that, in summary, query and index movie data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) using their [api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to an elasticsearch database and then expose that data using graphql to a react front end.

### Progress

My progress today was setting up this blog and getting the monorepo minimally configured to start adding some actual code tomorrow.
