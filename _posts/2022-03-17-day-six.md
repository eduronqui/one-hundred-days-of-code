## #100DaysOfCode

My last update was precisely a week ago and I actually needed this time.
Balancing #100DaysOfCode challenge and my personal life has been challenging and, of course, the challenge lost priority.

I'm back now (for now, at least) and today I made some progress towards adding an integration with Kafka.
I'm not yet using schemas to validate and serialize the messages but this will come in the next few days.

### Progress

Today I added a POC integration with kafka, which I'll improve over the next days.
Also, I've fixed a couple of bugs on shutdown and added a readme file for `content-emitter`.
