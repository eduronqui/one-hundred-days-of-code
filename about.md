Hi!

I'm Eduardo. Glad you're here!

I've been working as a software developer since 2014 and lately I've been feeling that I'm loosing my mojo and getting rusted and this project is an opportunity to get back on track doing something cool and exciting while learning some interesting things.

This is where I'll share in more details my progress over my #100DaysOfCode project.

My project's repo: [content-monorepo](https://github.com/eduronqui/content-monorepo)

To learn more about the #100DaysOfCode challenge check the official page at [100daysofcode.com](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).
